# -------------------------------------- URL --------------------------------------

- The ‘url’ module provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing. The getters and setters implement the properties of URL objects on the class prototype, and the URL class is available on the global object.

- The new URL() method is an inbuilt application programming interface of the URL module which creates a new URL object by parsing the input relative to the base. If the base is passed as a string, it will be parsed equivalent to new URL(base).

- Syntax:

        new URL(input[, base])

- Return Value: It returns the new URL generated along with an array of data like hostname, protocol, pathname, etc.
