## ------------------------- Node.js Buffers -------------------------


### Introduction to Buffers
- Buffer refers to space in memory which is used to store data temporarily. 
- The buffers module provides a way of handling streams of binary data.
- A buffer has traditionally been used between devices with speed mis-match so that they can keep on operating at their respective speeds without loss of data. In Node.js Buffers are used when dealing with file streams or tcp streams which are mainly octets of binary data.
